"""
This module defines a Flask blueprint for the game-related routes.

The `game` route fetches and combines the game state and game statistics and displays them
on the game information page (`game.html`). It ensures that both the game state and game stats
are available before rendering the page, and returns error messages if there are issues with 
fetching the data.

Returns:
    None: This module doesn't return values directly, but provides routes for the Flask app.
