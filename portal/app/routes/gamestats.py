"""
This module defines the `gamestats` blueprint for managing game statistics and exposing
related metrics.

It provides endpoints for receiving game stats data, storing it in memory, and retrieving
the current game stats. Additionally, it defines Prometheus metrics for tracking various
aspects of the game, such as the number of games played,the highest score, win streaks,
and other cumulative game stats.

Returns:
    None: This module does not return any values directly but provides Flask routes and 
    Prometheus metrics.
