"""
This module defines the `gamestate` blueprint for managing the game state and exposing 
related metrics.

It provides endpoints for receiving game state data, storing it in memory, and retrieving 
the current game state. Additionally, it defines Prometheus metrics for tracking various 
aspects of the game, such as reward rooms,monster spawn fuse, and total gold generated.

Returns:
    None: This module does not return values directly but provides Flask routes and 
    Prometheus metrics.
