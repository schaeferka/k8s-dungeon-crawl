"""
This module defines the API endpoints for managing player data in the K8s Dungeon Crawl game.

It includes the following functionalities:

1. Displaying the player data on a dedicated player page.
2. Retrieving specific player metrics such as health points, gold, depth, strength, etc.
3. Receiving and updating player data via a POST request, validating the input using the Player model.
4. Providing the current state of the player data, including various in-game statistics.

Endpoints:
- /hp: Returns the current player hit points (hp).
- /gold: Returns the amount of gold collected by the player.
- /depth: Returns the current depth level of the player.
- /deepest-level: Returns the deepest level the player has reached.
- /max-hp: Returns the maximum hit points (hp) of the player.
- /strength: Returns the current strength of the player.
- /: Displays the player page.
- /update: Receives player data via a POST request and updates the in-memory storage.
- /data: Returns the current player data as a JSON response.

The player data is stored in an in-memory dictionary and validated using the Player model.
