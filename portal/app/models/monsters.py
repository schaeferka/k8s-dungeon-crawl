"""
This module defines the data models for the monsters in the K8s Dungeon Crawl game.

It includes the following classes:

1. Position: Represents the position of a monster in the game world, with x and y coordinates.
2. Monster: Represents a monster's attributes and behaviors, including health, attack speed, 
   defense, damage, and position.
   
The Monster class is initialized with various attributes and includes methods for converting the
instance to a dictionary and logging its initialization.

Additionally, this module integrates with Flask for logging, and the Monster class uses Pydantic
for data validation and serialization.
