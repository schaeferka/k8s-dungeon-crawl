This module defines the `GameStats` class, which represents the game statistics
for a player, tracking various metrics about their gameplay history.

The class uses Pydantic's `BaseModel` for data validation and serialization.
It contains attributes that track statistics such as games played, games won,
scores, and performance metrics across different game sessions.

Returns:
    None: No return values for this module.
