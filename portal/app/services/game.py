"""
This module defines the `GameService` class, which is responsible for managing and updating
the game state and game statistics. It provides functionality to update, retrieve, and reset 
the game state and stats, and integrates with Prometheus to expose game-related metrics.

The `GameService` class offers the following features:
- Updating the game state and game statistics with new data.
- Resetting the game state and statistics for a new session.
- Retrieving the current game state and statistics.
- Integrating with Prometheus to track metrics such as reward rooms generated, gold collected,
  game progression, and more.

Prometheus metrics tracked by this module include:
- `brogue_reward_rooms_generated`: Number of reward rooms generated.
- `brogue_monster_spawn_fuse`: Time until a monster spawns.
- `brogue_gold_generated`: Total gold generated.
- `brogue_absolute_turn_number`: Total turns since the game started.
- `brogue_milliseconds_since_launch`: Time elapsed since the game launched.
- `brogue_game_has_ended`: Whether the game has ended.
- `brogue_games_played`: Total number of games played.
- `brogue_games_won`: Total number of games won.
- `brogue_game_deepest_level`: Deepest level reached in any game.
- `brogue_cumulative_gold`: Total gold collected across all games.

This module provides an interface for interacting with the game state, game statistics, and 
tracking key gameplay metrics.
