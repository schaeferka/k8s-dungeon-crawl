"""
This module defines the `MetricsService` class, which is responsible for managing and updating
Prometheus metrics related to the game, including player stats, game events, and monster data.

It uses the `prometheus_client` library to expose various metrics such as the amount of gold
collected by the player, the player's current depth level, the number of games played, and monster 
creation and death data.

The class also integrates logging to track metric updates and events.

Prometheus Metrics:
- `brogue_player_gold`: Amount of gold collected by the player.
- `brogue_depth_level`: Current depth level of the player.
- `brogue_player_current_hp`: Current hit points of the player.
- `brogue_games_played`: Total number of games played.
- `brogue_games_won`: Total number of games won.
- `brogue_monster_count`: Total number of monsters created.
- `brogue_monster_death_count`: Total number of monsters that have died.
- `brogue_monster_lifespan_seconds`: Time (in seconds) that monsters stay alive.
- `brogue_last_monster_created_timestamp`: Timestamp of the last monster created.
- `brogue_last_monster_death_timestamp`: Timestamp of the last monster death.

This service is designed to update and track the game's key metrics in real-time.

Returns:
    None: This module does not return any values.

    """
    A service class to manage Prometheus metrics for the game.

    This class provides methods to update and track various metrics related to the player,
    game events, and monsters. It uses Prometheus client libraries to define and update gauges, 
    counters, and histograms for tracking in-game statistics. Metrics are logged for monitoring
    purposes.

    Attributes:
        player_gold (Gauge): Tracks the amount of gold collected by the player.
        player_depth (Gauge): Tracks the player's current depth level in the game.
        player_current_hp (Gauge): Tracks the player's current health points.
        games_played (Counter): Tracks the total number of games played.
        games_won (Counter): Tracks the total number of games won.
        monster_count (Counter): Tracks the total number of monsters created.
        monster_death_count (Counter): Tracks the total number of monster deaths.
        monster_lifespan_histogram (Histogram): Tracks how long monsters stay alive in the game.
        last_monster_created (Gauge): Tracks the timestamp of the last monster created.
        last_monster_death (Gauge): Tracks the timestamp of the last monster death.

    Methods:
        update_player_metrics: Updates the player's metrics based on provided data.
        record_game_event: Records a game event such as "played" or "won".
        record_monster_creation: Records the creation of a new monster.
        record_monster_death: Records the death of a monster and updates related metrics.
        reset_metrics: Resets all metrics, typically for starting a new game.
